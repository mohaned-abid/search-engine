# search-engine


Finding the need to look for specific academic documents we decided to develop    a search engine for our university sup'com  to make looking for  documents much easier.

So  we created a PHP app that allows  users  to add documents delete or modify them (CRUD).

And deployed the app in docker (creating a custom dockerfile).

and then hosted the project on  AWS

used technologies:  PHP, javascript, AJAX, elasticsearch , docker , kubernetes , AWS.
